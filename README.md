## Project College Scout

We were inspired because we are approaching the age at which we apply to colleges, and as a result, we saw a need in discovering different universities that are not as well known.

Through this process, we learned about ourselves as well as how to integrate information from an API into a useful web application. We both enjoyed working on this project, will definitely do more hackathons in the future, and are extremely grateful for this opportunity.

The biggest challenge that we faced was the time constraint. If we had another day, we would have been able to make a few changes to better the website. Another challenge that we faced was the API not returning a proper output SAT and ACT scores at the beginning. However, we were able to figure it out and make it work.
